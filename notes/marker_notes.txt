In the context of the JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) file structure, markers are predefined two-byte codes that signify 
the beginning of different segments within the JPEG bitstream. Each marker starts with a 0xFF byte, followed by another byte 
that determines the type of the marker. These markers are used to parse and interpret the JPEG file correctly, as they indicate 
information like the start of an image, the end of an image, and where different elements of the compressed image data are 
located.

Here's a breakdown of some of the primary markers in the JFIF file format:

0xFFD8: SOI (Start of Image) - This marker designates the beginning of a JPEG file.

0xFFE0 to 0xFFEF: APPn (Application-specific) - These markers are reserved for application-specific information. 
The APP0 marker is where JFIF headers are stored, which contain important metadata like the version of the JFIF standard 
being used, resolution, and pixel density information.

0xFFDB: DQT (Define Quantization Table) - The DQT marker indicates the beginning of a quantization table, 
which is crucial for the decompression process as it determines how to reduce the file size without significant quality loss.

0xFFC0: SOF0 (Start of Frame, Baseline DCT) - The SOF marker designates the start of the frame and contains essential details 
like image dimensions, color components, and bit depth. There can be different types of SOF markers depending on the type of 
encoding (e.g., baseline or progressive).

0xFFC4: DHT (Define Huffman Table) - This marker specifies the Huffman tables used for encoding the image data. 
Huffman coding is a form of lossless compression used in the JPEG compression process.

0xFFDA: SOS (Start of Scan) - This marker designates the start of the scan, or the actual compressed image data, and 
includes information about the components and Huffman tables utilized in the scan.

0xFFD9: EOI (End of Image) - This marker signifies the end of a JPEG file.

In addition to these markers, there are several others used for various purposes, including restart markers, 
comment markers, and more. Markers are critical for the operation of JPEG decoders, as they communicate how to 
properly process and reconstruct the image from its compressed form.

Here's a simplified summary of how markers are used in a JPEG file:

The SOI marker signals the decoder to start interpreting the JPEG data.
The APPn markers provide additional application-specific information that may be used by some decoders.
The DQT, SOF0, and DHT markers define the tables and parameters needed for decompression.
The SOS marker leads to the section containing the entropy-coded segment, where the actual compressed image data begins.
The EOI marker indicates the end of the JPEG data stream and that the decoding process can be concluded.
Creating or parsing a JPEG file requires understanding the significance of these markers and using them in a structured 
sequence that complies with the JPEG standard.
